    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <pre>
Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no rerun
It's the anthem of now, before the day is done
Lost in the echoes, the ghosts of yesterday
Haunted by futures, that steal the now away
But hold up, rewind, that ain't the script we write
Gotta grip the moment, and seize the present light
'Cause only today's a promise, a canvas wide and clear
Drop the baggage of worry, let go of all the fear
Past is a lesson, future's a distant dream
Today is the stage, where actions reign supreme
No second chances for moments slipped and gone
But the power to build, keeps risin' with the dawn.
    </pre>

    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <pre>
They say time is money, but that's a twisted phrase
Time is a current, through these evolving days
Each tick a heartbeat, each breath a brand new start
Forget the what ifs, and listen to your heart
Only today to mend bridges broken down
Only today to wear that courage like a crown
To speak your truth, to lend a helping hand
To plant a seed of kindness in this barren land
Stopped by hesitation, crippled by the doubt
Trapped in the prison, that inner voice shouts
Break free from the chains, the what could have been
Let's rewrite the story, let victory begin.
    </pre>

    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
    <pre>
Look at the sunrise, a fire in the sky
A reminder that endings, give way to a new try
Yesterday's burdens, they crumble into dust
Today's the renewal, fueled by hope and trust
Forget the failures, the stumbles and the falls
They're just stepping stones, engraved upon the walls
Of your inner fortress, a testament to grit
Use 'em as fuel, light the fire, and don't you quit
Only today to chase the things you crave
To carve your legacy, and rise above the grave
Of mediocrity, the whispers of despair
Release the potential, let your greatness fill the air.
    </pre>

    <h2>Verse 4</h2>
    <pre>
Some chase the future, for riches and for fame
But miss the beauty, in this delicate game
Of life's simple pleasures, the laughter and the tears
The quiet moments, that conquer all our fears
The warmth of connection, the love that sets us free
The simple act of being, authentically you and me
Don't trade the present, for promises untold
Let every second count, more precious than pure gold
Only today to dance beneath the rain
To feel the sunlight, wash away the pain
To see the world with wonder, like a child's curious gaze
To find the magic hidden, in these ordinary days.
    </pre>

    <h2>Verse 5</h2>
    <pre>
So let the clock tick, let the minutes slip away
We ain't chasin' shadows, we're livin' for today
No regrets, no hesitations, just action pure and bold
A story yet unwritten, a future to unfold
Embrace the challenges, the hurdles in the path
They're just opportunities, to unleash your inner wrath
Against the forces, that try to hold you down
Stand tall, be resilient, wear your righteous crown
Only today to make a difference grand
To leave a mark of goodness, across this weary land
So rise up, reclaim the power you possess
Live every moment, with purpose and finesse.
    </pre>

    <h2>Outro</h2>
    <pre>
Yeah, only today. That's all we got.
So make it count.
No excuses, no regrets.
Live.
Today.
Word.
